DESCRIPTION
    # This folder contains  a README 
    corresponding to the problem statements in 
        Programming Assignment-3
    There are 4 cpp files and one report and one inp.txt



Instructions to Run the Program :

-> Follow these steps to run the parallel matrix multiplication program in C++:

Prerequisites :
-> Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

Input format :
-> Input is given through a text file "inp.txt".
-> It will consist of three parameters: N, K, RowInc and the matrix  

  

COMPLILING INSTRUCTIONS
    command to complile TAS code - g++ Assgn3_TAS_Src-CS22BTECH11018.cpp 
    command to execute compiled code - ./a.out
    output file name will be out1.txt. It contains the time taken  and resultant matrix 



    command to complile CAScode - g++ Assgn3_CAS_Src-CS22BTECH11018.cpp 
    command to execute compiled code - ./a.out
    output file name will be out2.txt. It contains the time taken  and resultant matrix 


   command to complile BCAS code - g++ Assgn3_BCAS_Src-CS22BTECH11018.cpp 
    command to execute compiled code - ./a.out
    output file name will be out3.txt. It contains the time taken  and resultant matrix 
    
     command to complile Atomic increment code - g++ Assgn3_AC_Src-CS22BTECH11018.cpp 
    command to execute compiled code - ./a.out
    output file name will be out4.txt. It contains the time taken  and resultant matrix 




After successfull compilation and running the program gives us the required out1.txt , out2.txt,out3.txt,out4.txt file containing 
(a) Time taken to compute the square matrix
(b) The resulting square matrix
respectively.
        

 Note :
-> Ensure that the input file `inp.txt` is in the same directory as the compiled binary.
-> Verify that you have the necessary permissions to execute the compiled binary.
-> If any issues arise during execution, ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
